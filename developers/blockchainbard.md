## Experience Statement

I have 6 years of programming experience across embedded systems using C and C++, backend development with NestJS, and some frontend work using React. I’ve also spent 4 years in data science and artificial intelligence, building Telegram bots with Python and JavaScript, and developing automated trading systems for forex.

I started working with web3 technologies in 2024, with some experience writing smart contracts in Solidity. Since then, my focus has shifted to the Sui blockchain.

I have been developing on Sui for the past 9 months. During that time, I’ve built several on-chain applications, including a decentralized voting systm, decentralized lottery system (with NFT-based tickets), a lending and borrowing smart contract, and a swapping smart contract. I’ve also integrated off-chain components like indexing, token price storage, and event-based backend syncing using TypeScript and Prisma.

I am comfortable writing Move and with a broad range of Sui development tools such as Sui CLI, Sui SDKs, and PTBs. My development experience spans from protocol-level work to user-facing dApps, with a strong focus on backend infrastructure and smart contract design.
