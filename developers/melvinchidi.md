## Experience Statement
I am a fullstack developer with over 5 years of experience using the MERN stack to build robust applications. I also work extensively with Java (Spring Boot) and NestJS for backend systems, delivering scalable and high-performance solutions.  

I started blockchain development with **Sui**, and it has helped me gain a strong understanding of blockchain concepts and smart contract engineering. Since starting around March/April 2025, I have deployed several projects to **testnet** and **devnet**.  

My background spans various areas:  
- Backend engineering with NestJS and Java Spring Boot.  
- Frontend development with React.  
- AI agents for automated systems.  

Here are some projects I would love to showcase:  
- **Sui Quest** – [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Emmanuelmelvin/sui_quest)  
- **Certificate Verification System** – Built using blockchain for secure credential validation.  

I am comfortable writing **Move** and working with a broad range of Sui development tools including **Sui CLI**, **Sui SDKs**, and **PTBs**. My expertise covers both protocol-level work and user-facing dApps, with a particular strength in backend infrastructure and smart contract design.
