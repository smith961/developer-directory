## Sui Packages

## Experience Statement


I have 3 years of web2 programming experience, primarily backend work using Java, Python, Flask and relational databases. Since then, I have been working with web3 technologies for 6 months on Sui, using Sui Move.

I have been developing on Sui for the last 6 months and have deployed two projects to testnet - an experimental NFT launchpad and a proposal dashboard.

I am comfortable writing Move and with a broad range of Sui development tools. I have also spent a lot of time with NFTs when building the NFT launchpad.
