## Sui Packages


## Experience Statement

I have over four years of experience as a developer, with a strong focus on front-end development using Next.js, React, and a variety of modern front-end technologies. I am also experienced in backend development with Node.js and Django, as well as smart contract development. I started working with Solidity in 2023 and transitioned into the Sui ecosystem in 2024 Q4 via the sui on campus hackthon program  of the same year, where Iâ€™ve been building and deploying projects.

In addition to my work in full-stack development, I am currently exploring machine learning for my final year project, further broadening my skill set. With a solid foundation in both web development and blockchain technologies, I am adept at tackling a wide range of development challenges.
