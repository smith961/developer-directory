## Experience Statement

I have 4 years of web2 programming experience, primarily both frontend and backend work using Javascript, Python, PHP, Typescript, Nextjs, etc-- and both relational and non-relational  databases. Eversince, I have  worked with web3 technologies for about 4 months on Sui, using Sui Move and the available SDKs.

I have been developing on Sui for the last 4 months and have worked on couple of projects, none to mainnet yet.

I am comfortable writing Move and with a broad range of Sui development tools. I have also spent a lot of time with PTBs and studying and testing the SDK against the CLI.
