## Experience Statement

I’ve been building in the blockchain space for over 4 years, primarily on EVM chains using Solidity, Foundry, and a range of related tools. I also have solid backend experience using Python and FastAPI.

Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects including:

- **Poply NFT Marketplace** ([poply.xyz](https://poply.xyz)) — wrote the smart contracts powering the NFT drop system  
- **Metamove** ([metamove.ai](https://metamove.ai)) — contributed the Move-to-Earn smart contracts  
- A variety of other systems including DeFi protocols, stablecoins, Uniswap Hooks, tokens, and staking flows.

Recently, I discovered Sui and found it exciting. I’ve been building experimental projects on Sui, including a stablecoin and DeFi-related concepts, to deepen my understanding and contribute to the ecosystem.

I’m passionate about smart contract engineering and enjoy building systems that are clean, composable, and meaningful to users.
