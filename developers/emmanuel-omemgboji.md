## Experience Statement

I am a seasoned developer with 5 years of Web2 experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and relational databases. For the past 2 years, I’ve focused on Web3 development, initially on Ethereum and Starknet using Foundry and Hardhat. Over the last 6 months, I’ve specialized in Sui blockchain development, deploying bondcraft projects to testnet: a decentralized launchpad that uses bonding curve, and `suiclient-error-decoder`, a TypeScript library for decoding Sui transaction errors.

I am proficient in writing Move smart contracts for Sui, leveraging tools like PTBs for transaction scripting and Sui’s SDK for robust dApp development. Additionally, I excel in frontend integration, building responsive, modern UIs with Next.js and Tailwind CSS to connect Sui smart contracts with user-friendly interfaces. My work combines secure smart contract engineering with seamless frontend experiences, enhancing the usability of Sui-based dApps and DeFi protocols.
