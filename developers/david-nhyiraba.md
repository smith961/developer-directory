## Experience Statement

I have 2 years of software engineering experience in web2, with proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, React, and React Native. I have built robust mobile apps, fintech solutions, and web applications. Over the past 11 months, I have worked with web3 technologies on Ethereum, primarily using Hardhat.

In the last 4 months, I have focused on the Sui ecosystem, developing and deploying two projects—ChainForex and Betpilot—and collaborating on Auctions, an NFT platform by SuiNetworkGhana. I have spent significant time working with PTBs and am increasingly comfortable with Move. I am passionate about web3, especially Sui, and believe Move is the future of blockchain programming.

Additionally, I am a DevRel at SuiNetworkGhana, where I teach newcomers and guide them in exploring the Sui blockchain ecosystem.
