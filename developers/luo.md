## Experience Statement

I have years of DevOps experience, specializing in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Golang, and Rust development. I'm familiar with common CI/CD processes and DevOps practices. Currently, I'm actively learning Sui blockchain technology, focusing on Move programming language and ecosystem tools like Walrus and Seal.

I have a solid foundation in traditional software engineering and am now expanding my skills into the Web3 space, particularly interested in Sui's high-performance architecture and object model.
