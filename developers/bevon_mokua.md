Experience Statement
I have 5 months of hands-on experience working with the Move language and Sui blockchain. During this time, I've developed both frontend and backend systems using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express.

I’ve built full-stack integrations with Walrus Protocol, connecting on-chain logic to user-facing UIs and backend processes. My work has focused on smart contract interaction, wallet integration, and custom flows tailored to the Sui ecosystem.

I’m comfortable writing in Move, deploying contracts, and building seamless dApp experiences. I’ve built tools that integrate on-chain functionality with user authentication, event-driven features, and wallet logic — all designed for real-world usability.
