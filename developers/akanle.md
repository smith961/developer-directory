## Experience Statement

I have 4 years of web2 programming experience, primarily both backend and frontend work using Typescript, Rust, Java, Golang, Nextjs, etc-- and both relational and non-relational  databases. Since then, I have been working with web3 technologies for about 5 months on Sui, using Sui Move and the available SDKs.

I have been developing on Sui for the last 5 months and have deployed couple of projects on testnet and devnet, none to mainnet yet -- An Agreement Aggregator, A Patent Manager, and a Competitions Manager.

I am comfortable writing Move and with a broad range of Sui development tools. I have also spent a lot of time with PTBs and studying and testing the SDK against the CLI.
