## Experience Statement

I have 3 years of web2 programming experience, primarily backend work using python, C++ as my first languadge and also language versatile. Since then, I have been working with web3 technologies for 2 years on Ethereum using scalfoldeth and Hardhat.

I have been developing on Sui for the last 6 months and have deployed three projects to testnet - an experimental NFT marketplace and a voting application and a  website to mint NFT using walrus for the store of blobs. Writing the contract logic for Bullz and doing the integration.
I have taught people how to write move and do integrationn through suinetworkGhana developer meetups.
