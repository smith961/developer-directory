## Experience Statement

I have 6 years of programming experience, both in Web2 and in the Web3 space, I've built primarily on EVM chains using Solidity, and Solana using Rust and Anchor Framework. Almost a year ago, I got Intrigued by Sui technology and naturally transitioned to Sui Move.

I’ve since then been developing on Sui and have built a variety of projects, with my highlight being DotAsap — a protocol that aggregates user requests directly from their Sui wallet transfers. It uses a custom-built Sui memo protocol to parse and route these requests to perform various on-chain actions. For this project, I worked extensively with core Sui technologies and developed a custom SDK.

I’m passionate about smart contract engineering, I am also social and work well with teams.
