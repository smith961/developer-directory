## Experience Statement

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Uyo with 4 years of programming experience. I primarily write Rust and Express.js, with additional background in C and C++ for low-level systems.

I began my blockchain development journey by writing smart contracts in Rust on the Solana blockchain. That foundation made it natural to transition to Sui Move, where I’ve been actively building for the past 5 months.

My main project on Sui so far is an NFT ticketing platform—a complete on-chain and off-chain system that handles event creation, ticket minting, transfers, and validation. I’ve also worked with tools like the Sui CLI, SDKs, PTBs, and integrated custom tokens and event-based backend syncing with TypeScript and Prisma.

I have some experience with AI, especially in the context of bot development and backend automation.

I’m comfortable working across the smart contract layer and backend infrastructure, with a strong focus on systems that bridge protocol logic and real user experiences.
